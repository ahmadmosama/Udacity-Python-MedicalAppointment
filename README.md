# Udacity-Python-MedicalAppointment
For the final project, you will conduct your own data analysis and create a file to share that documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then you should use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. You will not be required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but you should make it clear in your communications that your findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer. 

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. 
● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment. 
● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital. 
● ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família. 
● Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
